    <p>Hiring for top management can be tricky. Those making the hiring decisions don't have ample time to go through an entire resume. Those applying, i.e. the ultra-accomplished corporate executives, do not know how to correctly leverage their experience and achievements.Â 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I decided to bridge that gap through my Venture CXO branding. Here my team and I collectively help these interviewees ace these interviews by designing and writing concise and competency based Cover letters, resumes and Video introductions.</p>

    <p> We also help them build a personal brand on LinkedIn as an additional asset that can help them get the best industry opportunities.

    <p>For the 20+ Youngsters, I conceptualised 'Propelling Stories', where we help individuals to revamp their personal / digital presence through websites and social media strategies. We harness the impeccable power of story-telling and illustrations to capture the ever declining attention spans and evoke powerful emotions.
